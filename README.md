This is for my Research Project, it's essential to note that these scripts, on their own, are insufficient. 
The ML-Agent Toolkit, along with various other components not included in this repository, is required for their proper functioning.

The primary purpose of providing these scripts is to showcase the combat agent script for future reference.
It serves as a resource for individuals interested in understanding how to dynamically change the model during runtime and offers a potential
approach to rewarding and designing an agent.
